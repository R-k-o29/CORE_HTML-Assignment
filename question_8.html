        <li>LAMP</li>
        <dl>LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web development, it delivers the best cost efficiency, flexibility, and performance. It is an acronym that stands for:
        <ul>Linux (operating system)</ul>
        <ul>Apache (HTTP server)</ul>
        <ul>MySQL (relational database management)</ul>
        <ul>PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)</ul>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <li>ASP.NET</li>
        <li>Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very lightweight and can run on Windows and Linux. Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught the attention of developers all over the world. Now with .NET 5, you don’t have to think as much about .NET Framework vs .NET Core.
